Project SNRBoost


- Step 1 : 
  - access an online file store (Google Photos, Drive, etc)
  - take an upload archive of pics
    
- Step 2: Run OCR to extract the text in the pictures
  
- Step 3: Use an embedding model to embed each node (pic) with all text context extracted from the pic

- Step 4: Create a (chrome) browser extension that takes a query or keyword, performs similarity search and returns the top-k relevant pictures that can be copied

Example query - `Employemnt data` returns infographics of historical employment

- Step 5: Create an ioS app for use in mobile
  
- Step 6: Augment the context with Vision-LLM models that can 'describe' the data (Phi3-V, Llama3-Vision, etc)
