SecondWind: Welcome to my blog

My first hobby project in a while, one I have wanted to build for several months - `SNRBoost`. For someone that is chronically online, especially on Twitter ( I refuse to call it X, sorry Elon), I tend to get into a lot of tweetstorms, debates, arguments, even some namecalling (*gasp*) when things get heated up. As I primarily browse the app on my phone, I've always wished there was an easy way to back up my arguments and claims with data. Good news is there is plenty of data/infographics/visualizations floating around on the app. Bad news is - its hella difficult to curate, sort and search through to find the right one in a few seconds!

Here's where `SNRBoost` makes a difference. Btw, the name literally stands for boosting the Signal-to-Noise ratio in online conversations. Imagine you have an unorganized collection of pictures and bookmarked tweets that you have painstakingly collected over the years.
